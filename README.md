# UNP-Project_BI-with-Power-BI_HR-EMPLOYEE-ATTRITION
The data set is related to the Hr Employee Attrition.This data tells us about the empoyees count that are leaving the organisation due to various reasons.This will help the HR managers and decision-makers to take action and develop strategies to reduce attrition rates, improve employee satisfaction, and retain valuable employees. I hope this can be useful to anyone interested in understanding and improving HR practices.
